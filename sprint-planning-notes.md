### App Details
#### Client side
* Logging data
* Viewing past data (Graphs, notes etc)
* Eg. For cardio Graph of miles per day
Example Flow: Login -> Home Page -> Log Data -> look at page with all previous logs

#### Trainer side 
* Client List 
* View all their data
* Assign specific metrics to log (Cardio, Calorie intake)
* Long list of options to log (Weight, Pushups, Cardio, Calorie Intake, Protein Intake) (Switch) 
** Point of this: personalized to the client
* Sends invites for Clients to join

Example Flow: Login -> Home Page -> Choose client -> look at page with all previous logs for client

#### Nice to haves:
* Connect 1 client to more than 1 trainer
* Messaging between trainer and client
* Let users input nutrition info through scanning barcodes

### Action Items
* Figure out what metrics we want to include 
* What database are we using to store information?
* How are we handling login/auth?
* List out the different screens/view controllers we'll need
