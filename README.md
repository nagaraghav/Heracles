## Project Description
Our app aims to help fitness trainers better manage their clients. Clients will be able log their diet/calorie intake and nutrition information prescribed by their trainers on a daily basis. Trainers can then view client-specific logs on this app with a creative visualization of the data to detect trends over time or inspect data for a specific day.
